Some markdown extensions for python-markdown.

These are written for my personal use, and published for your
convenience. Youâ€™ll not get much support from me here.

- codeblocks.py: Similar to Github codeblocks, using markup that
  highlight.js can understand.
- metadata.py: Simple way of adding metadata using RFC822-like
  headers.
- coins.py: Add COinS metadata to your blog post from the
  aforementioned metadata.
- cite.py: Wikipedia-style citations.
